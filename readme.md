# Getting Started with Vite Tailwind Scaffolding

This is an extension of the official React Typescript template for [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

This template includes:

 * Typescript (including absolute path imports)
 * Tailwind / PostCSS (including JIT compilation for supert-fast dev startup)
 * ESLint / Prettier + VSCode settings (for linting, and autoformatting on save)
 * FontAwesome (because icons)
 * Valtio (because state)

To use this template, run `degit githubrepo/...` when creating a new app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn serve`

Serves the `build` folder for production testing before deployment.
